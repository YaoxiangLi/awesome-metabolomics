## Databases

- **RaMP** - A comprehensive database providing access to biological pathways, ontologies, chemical descriptions, and reactions. It draws from HMDB, KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways among others. [Visit RaMP](https://rampdb.nih.gov/)

- **KEGG** - The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes offers a systematic analysis of gene functions, connecting genes to molecules in the network. It features extensive metabolic and regulatory pathways. [Explore KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/)

- **Reactome** - An open-source, curated pathway database that supports the visualization, interpretation, and analysis of pathway knowledge. It includes a vast collection of human pathways and bioinformatic tools. [Discover Reactome](https://reactome.org/)

- **BioCyc** - A collection of pathway/genome databases with quality data curated from thousands of publications. It offers tools for navigating, visualizing, and analyzing the databases. [Browse BioCyc](https://biocyc.org/)

- **HMDB (Human Metabolome Database)** - Contains detailed information about small molecule metabolites found in the human body, supporting metabolomics, clinical chemistry, and biomarker discovery. [Check out HMDB](http://www.hmdb.ca/)

## Tools and Software

- **XCMS and MZmine**: Comprehensive platforms for processing LC-MS data, offering feature detection, alignment, and quantification. Essential for in-depth metabolomics analysis.

- **asari**: A cutting-edge tool addressing mass alignment and feature selection issues, implementing the "mass track" concept for improved metabolite identification accuracy. [Learn more about asari](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19552-7)

- **CSI:FingerID within SIRIUS**: Facilitates compound identification by predicting molecular formulas and matching them against database entries, using mass spectrometry data. [Explore CSI:FingerID](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0344-8)

- **MetaboAnalyst**: A web-based platform for comprehensive metabolomics data analysis, including statistical analysis and pathway analysis. [Visit MetaboAnalyst](https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/)
